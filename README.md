# spotify_clone_using_JS

This is the explaination of the project.

Here I have used 3 stylesheets (1 for PC styling ,other two for tablets and mobile screens) for better responsiveness of the website along with 1 HTML file and 1 JS file.

In this project ,I have made:

1. A navbar(currently buttons are not working,only styling is done)
2. A song list with 4 songs currently and a play button to randomly play a song by clicking on the song(I have uploaded audio files as well)
3. A bottom bar where current track plays .It consists of a GIF, progress bar along with play,previous and forward button to play previous track,next track, play/pause the music or changing the time interval of the music

Thanks for viewing!
